// To future me:
// good luck with debugging this code UwU
// your sanity will probably be at the worst state possible with the way im implementing ticks, actions and events ðŸ’€

// so the fight should update 64 times a second (so 64 tick per second)
// this means that we need to check if player should take an action and if yes we need to wait until this action gets performed,
// and then we need to wait until the action and or enemy action ended so that next action can be selected and performed
